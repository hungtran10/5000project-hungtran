# Project Overview

- **Goals**: The goal of this project is to extract as many insights out of the data as possible about customer's preferences for online vs. in-person shopping through various modeling techniques using Customer Expenditure Survey Data. I want to be able to learn how to use data collected to train models to predict outcomes and potentially have an impact on how business conduct strategic decision-making. 
- **Motivation**: I am motivated to help businesses have a better understanding of their customers' shopping habits and provide some background information for customers who are more inclined to shop online. More specifically, I want businesses to be more aware of how they can enhance customer segmentation for channel preference. Doing so allows businesses to identify which customer segments prefer one channel over the other, and changes can be made tailor delivery channels more effectively.
- **Objectives**: My object for this project is to improve my proficiency in all stages of a data science project. I want to clean data well, craft informative EDA visualizations, execute unsupervised and supervised learning so that I can understand the variables that impact the outcomes of my research questions. In particular, I want to use the supervised learning methods in class such as Decision Trees and Random Forests to conduct my analysis.


### Data Source
**Source:** Public use microdata (2023) from Consumer Expenditure Survey Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The 2023 data can be accessed at the [URL](https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm#csv).  


## Project Workflow
This is a data science project so I will be utilizing key stages in the data science pipeline to get to the conclusions that I am looking for. First, I will gather data and clean it. Then, I will conduct exploratory data analysis by identifying key statistics and data visualizations to create preliminary insights on the customers. Next, I will conduct unsupervised learning where I will identify clusters based on the  variables in the data. Lastly, I will implement predictive modeling to test regression, binary classification and multi-class classification models' abilities to predict the outcomes in my data. 

## Hypotheses

- Certain race groups, married people and those who work full-time in the last year are more likely to shop online.
- The more educated individuals, e.g. people with bachelor's, master's and beyond, are most likely to shop online and spend more due to their higher earning power provided by their education.
- One's annual online shopping expense can be predicted by their income level. 
- Younger people are more likely to shop onlmine. 

## Challenges

- **Finding data:** Given the nature of this topic, it took me a while to locate publicly available data.
- **Data cleaning:** The data came in a number of CSV files organized in a star schema meaning that is composed of a single, central set of fact tables that is surrounded by dimension tables. Moreover, all the variables per file had a unique naming system and encoded so I had to refer to a data dictionary to decode them.
- **Data Limitations:** Although I had around 39,000 rows in the cleaned dataset, it was imbalanced between individuals who have shopped online in 2023 vs. those who did not. This made predictive modeling more challenging as I had to do resampling to achieve a more balanced dataset. 
- **Strong Predictive Power:** The strong predictive performance of my models in the classification tasks were suprising, and this raises questions about overfitting.

## Conclusion and Future Steps

### Key Technical Insights and Outcomes

1. **Data Analysis and Insights**:  
   - Key predictors included income, education, race, and marital status. For example, higher-income individuals and those with advanced education degrees were more likely to shop online, whereas other demographics showed a preference for in-person shopping.  
   - Spending patterns also varied across racial groups, with Asians spending significantly more online, hinting at possible cultural or access-related trends.  

2. **Modeling Outcomes**:  
   - Models like XGBoost and Random Forest achieved perfect performance metrics, demonstrating their ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.  
   - Decision Trees algorithms were also a top performer, but they are limited their proneness to overfitting, limiting generalizability. 
   - Logistic Regression provided interpretability but was slightly less robust for capturing complex patterns in the data.  
   - Linear models like LinearSVC exhibited sensitivity to class imbalances, with reduced recall for minority classes.  
   - Overall, the project showcased strong predictive accuracy, validating the importance of demographic and financial features in understanding shopping preferences.

3. **Business Implications**:  
   - These insights enable businesses to improve customer segmentation, inventory allocation, and marketing strategies.  
   - Predictive modeling allows for data-driven personalization, improving customer satisfaction and driving customer lifetime value.

### Potential Improvements and Refinements

1. **Addressing Class Imbalances**:  
   - Models like LinearSVC struggled with recall for minority groups due to imbalanced classes. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or cost-sensitive learning could enhance performance. Alternatively, more robust data can address this issue.

2. **Incorporate More Types of Data**:  
   - Explore additional features, such as behavioral data (e.g., shopping frequency, preferred categories) to improve further predictions.  
   - Incorporate geospatial variables to understand regional preferences for online vs. in-person shopping.

3. **Validation Across Broader Datasets**:  
   - The current dataset demonstrated strong predictive power. However, testing on external datasets or across different regions, industries, or customer bases would improve generalizability.  

4. **Incorporate Temporal Analysis**:  
   - Use time series data to analyze how preferences evolve over time to identify trends or seasonal patterns, enabling dynamic business strategies.


### Actionable Recommendations for Further Research 

1. **Expand Data Scope**:  
   - Incorporate additional data sources, such as customer reviews, customer interaction data, customer purchase history, web traffic analytics, or loyalty program participation, to refine predictions and insights.  
   - If available, include psychographic data (e.g., lifestyle and interests) for deeper customer understanding.

2. **Develop Real-Time Prediction Systems**:  
   - Implement real-time predictive analytics to dynamically identify customer preferences and adapt inventory and promotions accordingly.  
   - For example, use model outputs to instantly target online-exclusive offers to customers flagged as online shoppers.

3. **Test Location and Segment-Specific Strategies**:  
   - Design A/B tests to evaluate how insights about online vs. in-person preferences translate into actionable marketing strategies.  
   - For instance, test the effectiveness of customer-specific online promotions for high-income shoppers or in-store campaigns for segments preferring physical shopping.
