# Overview


- **Goals**: The goal of this project is to extract as many insights out of the data as possible about customer's preferences for online vs. in-person shopping through various modeling techniques. I want to be able to learn how to use data collected to train models to predict outcomes and potentially have an impact on how business conduct strategic decision-making. 
- **Motivation**: I am motivated to help businesses have a better understanding of their customers' shopping habits and provide some background information for customers who are more inclined to shop online. More specifically, I want businesses to be more aware of how they can enhance customer segmentation for channel preference. Doing so allows businesses to identify which customer segments prefer one channel over the other, and changes can be made tailor delivery channels more effectively.
- **Objectives**: My object for this project is to improve my proficiency in all stages of a data science project. I want to clean data well, craft informative EDA visualizations, execute unsupervised and supervised learning so that I can understand the variables that impact the outcomes of my research questions. In particular, I want to use the supervised learning methods in class such as Decision Trees and Random Forests to conduct my analysis.
